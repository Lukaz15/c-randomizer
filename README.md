# C Randomizer

### This is my choice for a first C project, made in a day with the goal of learning C.

I chose this in particular just because I got the curiosity to understand <ins>how RNG is made at a low-level</ins>; so I made research and found 
this mathematical algorithm to generate pseudo-random numbers, and then read C documentation to learn how to implement it.
